# About the project : This project was a task assigned during my Pwc job stimulation program.
The call center manager needed a dashboard that will be used for discussion with the management. The dashboard should help understand customer and agent behavior by providing transparency and insights of the call center dataset.


# Objectives of the analysis

# Process of analysis 


- The dataset was loaded into powerBi
- The data was checked for inconsistencies (missing vaules, misspelt words and incorrect data type)
- The satisfaction rating in numbers was grouped into good, bad, excellent using conditional column
- The data was then taken to the report view for visualization
